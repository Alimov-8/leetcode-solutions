The idea is to go through the string and save in a hash map the number of times each character appears in the string. That would take O(N) time, where N is a number of characters in the string.


```py
# Time Complexity - O(n)
class Solution:
    def firstUniqChar(self, s: str) -> int:
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: int
        """
        # build hash map : character and how often it appears
        count = collections.Counter(s)
        
        # find the index
        for idx, ch in enumerate(s):
            if count[ch] == 1:
                return idx     
        return -1
```
